## vEGkaTAcalE paurNamI garuDa-sEvA

वेङ्कटाचले पौर्णमी गरुड-सेवा is observed on Paurṇamāsī tithi of Aspaṣhṭam (lunar) month (moonrise/puurvaviddha (default)).

Lord Malayappa rides on Garuda Vahanam in all four mada streets. This usually happens during Brahmotsavams, but since 2006, this has been happening on every `paurNamI`.
