Nadha Sharma (`muDavan`, i.e. lame man) and his wife Anavidyambikai came to Mayavaram in order to perform a `tulA snAnam` in Kaveri. However, by the time they arrived, it was the last day of `tulA mAsa` and they could not complete the `snAnam`. They were disappointed yet spent their time doing Puja of the Lord, who appeared in their dreams and asked them to take a bath next morning (1st day of Vrschika) and reap full benefits of the Tula Kaveri Snanam iteself!
